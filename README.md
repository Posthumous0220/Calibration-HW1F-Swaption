# Calibration-HW1F-Swaption
 The purpose of this project is to calibrate the HW1F model using the formulas and methods described in "Calibration Methods of Hull-White Model". [Here](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1514192) is the paper's link.

 The authors of the paper employed three methods to calibrate the model parameters, both constant and time-dependent.The main focus of this project is to replicate the calibration of parameters in constant form.

 ## Choice of Instruments
 The data for this project consists of trading data from the U.S. market, spanning from April 28, 2023, to July 24, 2023. It involves a swaption matrix composed of 9 maturities and 8 tenors.
 ## The calibration methods used in this project.
 The authors proposed a highly effective calibration method that balances resource utilization and fitting quality. This method cleverly leverages the properties of a swaption volatility approximation technique called SMM approximation,  allowing for the separate calibration of $a$ and "$/sigma$" and thereby improving performance.
